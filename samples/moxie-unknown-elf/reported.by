reporter_comment="Bare metal configuration for moxie architecture.

It appears to generate a broken toolchain. E.g. newlib's CRT expects
symbols __bss_start__ and __bss_end__, while linker script generates
__bss_start (no underscores at the end) and no __bss_end__whatsoever.

This is not a bug in crosstool-NG. If you're interested in saving the
moxie, please report this upstream."
